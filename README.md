## Abstract

> This work proposes a novel approach to B-Format AmbiX 3D speech enhancement based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representation. The model is a Fully Complex Convolutional Network (FC2N) that estimates a mask to be applied to the input features. Then, a final layer is responsible for converting the B-format to a monaural representation in which we apply the inverse STFT (ISTFT) operation. For the optimization process, we use a compounded loss function, applied in the time-domain, based on the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric combined with a perceptual loss on top of the wav2vec 2.0 model. The approach is applied on Task 1 of the L3DAS22 challenge, where our model achieves a score of 0.845 in the metric proposed by the challenge, using a subset of the development set as reference.
